💡 How It Works

The user enters a city or location in the search input.

The app fetches real-time weather data from a weather API.

Weather details such as temperature, location, date & time, and conditions are displayed.

Additional data like humidity, wind speed, and pressure are shown instantly.

UI updates dynamically without page reload.
